# HW-9-ReadME-Generator

## Description
We have created a ReadME generator that will allow the user to enter information for each section through node.js and it will then create a complete ReadME file. It will begin by asking for title, description, installation, usage, contribution, test, gitHub username, email, and which license to use. Once completed, it will input the information into a ReadME template. 

(insert added video with screencastify here)

## Installation
Go to https://github.com/torihendricks927/HW-9-ReadME-Generator to git clone the index.js with template. Then go into terminal and begin the node index.js sequence to complete the questions inserted into template. 

## Usage
As a developer, I want have a fill-in ReadME template so that I can create ReadME files in the most efficient way.

## Contributing
To contribute to the file, please go to github repo to use git fork and create a separate branch. Once contributions on file are completed, submit request to main branch so it can be reviewed prior to merging. 

## Tests
You can test index.js ReadME template by opeing terminal and using Node.js for file. It will initiate a series of questions that you can freely type in answer. Once all are completed, it will place information into template and create the new ReadME file.
